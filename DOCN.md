## Geographic Risk Evaluation
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Asset Geographic Concentration Risk**   |Well diversified| **1**|DigitalOcean operates 13–17 physical data centers across nine global regions, including: <br>United States: New York City (NYC1–NYC3), San Francisco (SFO2, SFO3), Atlanta-Douglasville (ATL1) </br> <br>Europe: Amsterdam (AMS3), London (LON1), Frankfurt (FRA1)</br><br>Asia-Pacific: Singapore (SGP1), Bengaluru (BLR1), Sydney (SYD1)</br> Canada: Toronto (TOR1). <br>The largest concentration in any U.S. metro is the New York City area, which houses three sites out of a total 13–17 globally. That means NYC represents ≤30% of the footprint</br>|   |
| **Revenue Geographic Concentration Risk** |Well Diversified|**0**|DOCN’s business is heavily U.S.-centric with strong presence in U.S. metros like New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Toronto. Global presence includes data centers in Amsterdam, London, Frankfurt, Singapore, Bangalore, Sydney, etc. According to MarketScreener data, in earlier years geography-based revenue (~2023) showed U.S. >50%, Europe ~222M, Asia ~182M, and "North America (ex U.S.)" contributing tens of millions—indicating international revenue of perhaps ~40–45%. |[Business Segments for DOCN](https://uk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/DIGITALOCEAN-HOLDINGS-INC-120405757/finances-segments/) |
| **High‑Risk Geographic Exposure** |Moderate Exposure   | **6**|U.S.: New York (NYC1–3), San Francisco (SFO2–3), Atlanta (ATL1)<br>International: Amsterdam (AMS3), London (LON1), Frankfurt (FRA1), Toronto, Singapore, Bangalore, Sydney</br>  New Jersey and Massachusetts rank among the highest-risk U.S. states for climate exposure out of 16 states studied; about 20% of data centers in New Jersey are considered at high future climate risk by 2050. Major U.S. hubs like Northern Virginia have witnessed high-profile near-miss events; grid operators warn that data center clusters may trigger cascading outages across PJM and ERCOT regions. CERTAIN regions where DOCN’s data centers sit (e.g., San Francisco and New York area) are within states experiencing grid delays and power congestion. Roughly 3 of DOCN’s 13–16 sites are in regions with documented grid or climate risk exposure: New Jersey (if applicable via NYC region), San Francisco, and possibly Toronto (Ontario climate/flood sensitivity).||
| **Natural Disaster & Climate Risk** | Moderate Risk |**4**|AMT operates ~42,Recent climate risk analysis indicates that ~20% of New Jersey data centers are already at high risk by 2050. San Francisco and northern California face significant grid and climate stress as well. DOCN has 3–4 sites in high/moderate risk locales (NYC/SF), which is approximately 20–30% of its total footprint |[Climite Threat to DCs](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/climate-threats-to-data-centers-set-to-surge-report/)  |
| **Market Saturation & Competition Risk**  |High Saturation|**7**|DigitalOcean exists in a market dominated by hyperscale cloud giants. DOCN primarily serves SMBs and digital-native developers, positioning itself as a simpler, cost-effective alternative while those hyperscalers chase enterprise segments. DOCN’s Scalers+ customer base (customers spending >$50/month) is growing rapidly, but capturing larger enterprise clients may still leave it trailing hyperscale providers. | |



## Customer Concentration Risk.
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Single Customer Dependency** | Low Dependency | **0** |DOCN states: “no material customer concentration… top 25 customers made up ~8% of revenue in 2024” (and 7% in 2023, 10% in 2022), indicating largest single customer is <10%.|  |
| **Top Customer Portfolio Concentration**     | Well Diversified |**0**| 	Top‑25 customers contributed ~8% of total revenue in 2024 (7% in 2023)—implying that even top 10 & 5 customers likely account for <50% and <40% thresholds for risk.| |
| **Customer Type & Pricing Power Risk**       | Favorable Mix | **0**|	DOCN primarily serves SMBs, developers, and startups globally via self‑service & marketplace model with less hyperscaler exposure—pricing power moderate and stable. |   |
| **Contract Duration & Revenue Stability**    | Weak Protection | **10**|	Most customers are on month‑to‑month usage-based plans, with only a growing minority on committed contracts—not traditional multi‑year contractual protection. |   |
| **Customer Financial Quality & Credit Risk** | Mixed Quality| **3**  | Customers include SMBs and startups, often unrated—financial stability varies widely, implying modest credit risk.| |
