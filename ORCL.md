|**Power Infrastructure Resilience & Security**|**Grid Redundancy & Backup Systems**|Multiple Grid Connections|**0**|Oracle OCI data centers adhere to Uptime Institute Tier III or Tier IV standards, with N+2 redundancy for critical systems like power distribution hardware. They provide multiple fault domains (FD) and availability domains (AD) per region, physically separated and with their own power paths and generators to support continuity even during failures. Oracle states that its data centers use redundant power sources and maintain on-site generator backups, regularly tested and continuously refueled to ensure performance during outages. Oracle has partnered with Bloom Energy to install on-site solid oxide fuel cell systems in OCI data centers in the U.S., enabling rapid costly backup or potentially primary power within 90 days—enhancing redundancy and resilience.|[Oracle, Bloom Energy strike data center power deal](https://www.power-eng.com/onsite-power/oracle-bloom-energy-strike-data-center-power-deal/) <br>[Security Guide for Oracle Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/exadatacloud/doc/ecs-security-guide.htmlhttps://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/exadatacloud/doc/ecs-security-guide.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</br> <br>[OCI High Availability, Disaster Recovery, and Reliability: A Complete Comparison](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/post/oci-high-availability-disaster-recovery-and-reliability-a-complete-comparison)</br> <br>[Oracle Backup and Disaster Recovery](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/backup-and-disaster-recovery/)</br>|
||**Regional Power Constraint Exposure** |<25% in Risk Regions |**5**|Oracle operates 50+ public cloud regions in over 24 countries spanning North America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia–Pacific regions, with many supported by multiple Availability Domains in-country for redundancy and resilience. In the U.S., OCI regions include Ashburn (VA), Phoenix (AZ), San Jose (CA), Dallas, Chicago, etc.—sites that overlap with known high-risk grids like Northern Virginia, California, and Phoenix. OCI also has regions in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, London, Tokyo, Mumbai, Seoul, and Sydney—major data/hub markets with stable grid infrastructure. |[Oracle Public Cloud Region and DCs](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/public-cloud-regions/) <br>[Oracle DC Locations](https://www.datacenters.com/providers/oracle/data-center-locations)</br>|
|**Power Capacity Growth & Scalability**| **Secured Future Power Capacity** | Multi‑Year Pipeline Secured | **0**|Oracle has entered the Stargate AI infrastructure partnership with OpenAI through which OpenAI will lease 4.5 GW of data center power in the United States, bringing the total Stargate footprint to over 5 GW, including the existing Abilene, TX site. Oracle is planning to double its data center capacity by the end of 2025, and its CapEx is expected to exceed $16 billion, more than double the prior year, specifically to support AI scale-out. Additional initiatives include deploying nuclear SMR-powered AI data centers and expanding into emerging markets (e.g. Netherlands) with dedicated cloud infrastructure investments. |[Oracle Earning release 2025 Q4](https://s23.q4cdn.com/440135859/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/4q25-pressrelease-June-final.pdf) <br>[Oracle Investor Relations](https://investor.oracle.com/home/default.aspx)</br> <br>[OpenAI and Oracle ink deal to build massive Stargate data center, total project will power 2 million AI chips](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-and-oracle-ink-deal-to-build-massive-stargate-data-center-total-project-will-power-2-million-ai-chips-stargate-partner-softbank-not-involved-in-the-project)</br> <br>[Oracle to Invest U.S. $1 Billion in AI and Cloud Infrastructure in the Netherlands](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-invests-one-billion-dollars-in-ai-and-cloud-infrastructure-2025-07-15/)</br>|
||**Power Procurement Strategy**|Diversified Long-Term Contracts|**0** |Oracle’s internal renewable energy guidance states the company aims for 100% renewable energy by 2025 and uses a diversified mix: on‑site renewables, high‑quality renewable energy certificates (RECs), and power purchase agreements (PPAs or VPPAs) where possible. They also explore other contract mechanisms where direct supply is available. Oracle has contracted with Bloom Energy to deploy solid oxide fuel cell systems at select U.S. OCI data centers. These provide clean, cost‑efficient, on‑site backup or primary power and can be deployed rapidly (within 90 days).Oracle is introducing a new methodology for hourly power‑based carbon emission tracking, indicating that its procurement framework supports granular carbon and power planning.|[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Contracts for Bloom Energy Fuel Cells On-site](https://www.microgridknowledge.com/data-center-microgrids/news/55305376/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-contracts-for-bloom-energy-fuel-cells-on-site)  <br>[OCI Carbon Emissions Analysis – Introducing more accurate power-based calculations](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/oci-carbon-emissions-power-based-calculations)</br>|
|**Energy Cost Management & Volatility**|**Power Cost Hedging/Stabilization**|  |Oracle’s procurement framework blends long-term renewable strategies (PPAs, on-site generation) with operational commitments and granular tracking—but the public record does not confirm formal price-hedging contracts or derivatives-based strategies that fully eliminate price risk portfolio-wide.|[Oracle Commitment to Renewable Energy](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/renewable-energy-guidance.pdf)  <br>[Simplify IT and Reduce TCO: Oracle’s End-to-End, Integrated Infrastructure for SAP Data Centers](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/simplify-it-reduce-tco-ds-2403156.pdf) </br>|
||**Energy Cost Transparency & Management** |Basic Disclosure | **3**|Oracle provides power‑based carbon emissions tracking with the OCI Carbon Emissions Analysis tool, which tracks usage per workload/hour and reports location-based vs market-based emissions values. Oracle’s sustainability agenda clearly communicates its renewable goals, emission reductions, and environmental impact, but is oriented around operational metrics rather than cost.No public disclosure of cost‑per-kWh figures, tariff structures, or facility-level power expense details is available. Oracle Cloud pricing documentation reflects service billing (compute/storage) but does not break out energy procurement costs or wholesale energy contract pricing. | |
|**Operational Energy Efficiency**|**Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)** |1.25~1.4 |**5**|The PUE for data centers in North America and Europe and aisia pacific are mostly falling into 1.25 ~ 1.4 range. For latin america would be must larger than 1.6. Oracle has documented its most efficient data centers reaching PUE ~1.15, which indicates above-average efficiency. Across the broader portfolio, PUE is likely under 1.4 given Oracle’s green cloud design and target goals.|[Oracle Clean Cloud OCI (Gen2) Data Sheet](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/citizenship/clean-cloud-oci.pdf) |
| |**Efficiency Improvement Trajectory**|No Historical Data| **8**|OCI has strong energy efficiency design principles (e.g., cooling optimization, on-site generation).Industry trends suggest Tier III/IV hyperscale operators target PUE improvements over time, but Oracle does not publish archived PUE metrics or trajectories for its Gen‑1 to Gen‑2 transitions.  |  [Oracle Investor Relations](https://investor.oracle.com/home/default.aspx)|

|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Asset Geographic Concentration Risk**   |Well diversified| **0**|As of mid‑2025, Oracle maintains approximately 50–51 public cloud regions in 24–26 countries, with multiple regions per country (e.g., two in Singapore, EU countries). Each region is composed of multiple availability domains, each comprising one data center with independent power, cooling, and network isolation.Deployment spans North & South America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, India, Asia‑Pacific, Japan, South Korea. Geographic expansion initiatives include major investments to establish new regions in Malaysia, Indonesia (Batam Island), Spain (Madrid), Saudi Arabia (Riyadh), Japan, New Zealand, and additional in MEA and Asia-Pacific markets. |  |
| **Revenue Geographic Concentration Risk** |Low concentrated|**1**| egional split: Americas ~63.3%, EMEA ~24.4%, Asia-Pacific ~12.3% of total revenue. Segment revenue breakdown: Cloud & License (~85–86% of revenue) dominated by OCI + Applications.|  |
| **High‑Risk Geographic Exposure** |Low ~ Moderate Exposure   | **3**|OCI includes major U.S. cloud regions such as us-sanjose‑1 (Silicon Valley)—part of a metro with grid stress from data center load—and us-ashburn-1 (Northern Virginia), which falls within the PJM grid region that experienced a near-systemic data center shutdown incident in 2024. Oracle is actively investing in a large Texas AI data center campus intended for use by OpenAI via a long-term agreement (~stargate project), placing significant capacity in ERCOT, another region with grid vulnerability. While Oracle is expanding its region network to over 50 regions across ~26 countries globally, the U.S. still likely accounts for 30–40%+ of total OCI deployment footprint, based on its large-capacity Ashburn, Phoenix, San Jose, and planned Texas site presence| |
| **Natural Disaster & Climate Risk** | Low Risk |**2**|U.S. regions include Northern California, Northern Virginia, Texas, and coastal East/West Coast sites—areas at risk of earthquakes, hurricanes, heatwaves, flood or grid stress.  OCI structures support resilient architecture: Oracle encourages customers to adopt two-region disaster recovery strategy, replicating critical workloads across regions to mitigate site-level failure. Oracle promotes High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR) via multi-region and multi-Availability Domain deployment using its Maximum Availability Architecture framework.| |
