|**Power Infrastructure Resilience & Security**|**Grid Redundancy & Backup Systems**|Multiple Grid Connections (at least at flagship site)|**2**|Hangzhou facility—a flagship VNET Tier III+/Tier IV data center located in Zhejiang province—is documented to feature dual-grid 2N electrical input and N+1 diesel generator backup, indicating high-availability design at least at this site. Corporate material indicates VNET operates over 50 data centers across 30+ cities and emphasizes robust infrastructure in cluster regions like Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Chengdu—but detailed grid design specs are not publicly stated for most facilities. |[Hangzhou DC](https://www.datacenters.com/vnet-group-inc-hangzhou)|
||**Regional Power Constraint Exposure** | <25% in Risk Regions| **0**| VNET Group operates more than 50 data centers across 30+ cities in China, including major economically powered regions such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Ningbo. This footprint is borough‑balanced and largely operated in central and eastern grid zones with robust reliability. Data supports carrier-neutral positioning in all major hubs (e.g., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Greater Bay Area) with diversified grid access. China’s high-capacity data center clusters are primarily located in eastern and coastal regions, not in locations with frequent outage risk like remote western provinces. VNET avoids grid-stressed zones such as Inner Mongolia western corridor or Xinjiang. |[VNET DC](https://www.vnet.com/en/) <br>[China Power](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-energy-security/)</br>|
|**Power Capacity Growth & Scalability**| **Secured Future Power Capacity** |Multiple Years Secured | **2**|VNET capacity under construction was 377MW, with a pre-commitment rate for capacity under construction stable at 81.6% as of the end of March. Additionally, capacity held for short-term future
development remained relatively steady at 256MW. Capacity held for long-term future development further expanded to 414MW, as we remain confident in China’s market growth potential as AI spurs greater demand for premium IDC services. We will maintain our robust expansion plan to ensure we are well prepared for further business growth. |[2025 Q1 Earning Call](https://ir.21vianet.com/static-files/83665048-b82d-4dfa-b58f-4e79cd973d40)|

## Geographic Risk Evaluation
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Asset Geographic Concentration Risk**   |Well diversified| **3**|VNET operates 50+ data centers across more than 30 cities, all within mainland China. There is no presence outside China. Although dispersed across ~30 cities (Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Greater Bay Area, Southwest China), there is no single metro hosting >40% of sites. |  |
| **Revenue Geographic Concentration Risk** |Low concentrated|**1**| According to SEC disclosures, all of VNET’s operating subsidiaries and Virtual Investment Entities (VIEs) are located in mainland China, with no international revenue-generating operations; geographic breakdowns in filings show no segmentation outside PRC revenue sources. 20‑F filings explicitly state: “revenues are derived from within the PRC; geographical segments are not presented”—confirming complete PRC exposure. |  |
| **High‑Risk Geographic Exposure** |Low ~ Moderate Exposure   | **4**|Tier-1 metros like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong cluster face high power demand, regulatory scrutiny, and rapid growth in data center deployments, stressing grid capacity. Ulanqab IDC Campus (Inner Mongolia) is a large-scale hub under development, located in a region relying on intermittent renewable sources with evolving grid stability. China’s rapid industrial expansion, coupled with regional power constraints and occasional extreme weather impacts (heatwaves, drought, dust storms) in northern regions like Inner Mongolia, adds physical exposure. A significant subset (~25–35%) of VNET's sites are located in high-demand urban industrial hubs with grid and environmental risk (e.g., Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong).| |
| **Natural Disaster & Climate Risk** | Low~Moderate Risk |**4**|VNET’s city-level spread across east coast megacities, Guangdong, and inland hubs including Ulanqab. Climate & water stress: ~41% of Chinese data centre racks (national average) lie in drought-prone regions; ~28% in high-risk zones. | |
| **Market Saturation & Competition Risk**  |High Saturation|**6**|China is actively addressing a data center build glut, with thousands of local and state-backed facilities operating at 20–30% utilization. The MIIT is launching a national network to consolidate and manage this surplus capacity. Its IDC market share was estimated at ~1.4% globally but rising to ~11% in China’s carrier-neutral segment in earlier years—suggesting intense domestic competition among several similarly sized operators and network operators.| |


## Customer Concentration Risk.
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Single Customer Dependency** | Moderate Dependency | **8** |SEC Form 20‑F indicates that a single customer generated more than 10% but less than 20% of total net revenue in both the nine-month periods ended Sep 30, 2023 and 2024.| |
| **Top Customer Portfolio Concentration**     | Moderately Concentrated	 |**5**|	Top-tier customers are not detailed, but aggregate disclosure notes multiple customers each under 1% individually, with the large carrier subsidiaries aggregating ~5–6% of revenue—suggesting top‑5 share likely between 40–60%.| |
| **Customer Type & Pricing Power Risk**       |  Mixed | **6**| VNET serves diverse customer base including enterprise, cloud (Azure/Office 365 operator), telco subsidiaries, and retail SMBs. Hyperscaler partnerships exist, but enterprise mix helps balance pricing power.|   |
| **Contract Duration & Revenue Stability**    | Moderate Protection | **4**|Contracts include build‑to‑suit and recurring hosting agreements (1–3 years typical) with auto-renewal; not all are long-term or take‑or‑pay, offering moderate contractual stability. |   |
| **Customer Financial Quality & Credit Risk** | Mixed Quality| **3**  |Customer base includes large telecom subsidiaries (higher credit quality) and smaller SMEs/startups—variation means mostly stable but not uniformly investment‑grade credit profile.|
