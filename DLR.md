|**Power Infrastructure Resilience & Security**|**Grid Redundancy & Backup Systems**| Multiple Grid Connections| **0**| DLR operates with Tier III-standard power infrastructure, including multiple grid feeds and N+1/2N UPS and generator redundancy. Fuel delivery agreements for backup power systems are on par with those held by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and allow for power to be maintained in the event of an extended power outage | [DLR 2024 Impact Report](https://s29.q4cdn.com/106493612/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Digital-Realty-2024-Impact-Report.pdf)|
||**Regional Power Constraint Exposure** | <25% in Risk Regions| **0**| DLR owns and operates 300+ data centers in 50+ metro markets across six continents. U.S. exposure includes high-risk hubs (Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley, Texas), but global diversification ensures no concentration in any high-risk zone.  | [DLR DCs](https://www.digitalrealty.com/data-centers)|
|**Power Capacity Growth & Scalability**| **Secured Future Power Capacity** | Multi-Year Pipeline Secured | **0**| DLR added over 200 MW of capacity in 2024, while increasing its development pipeline by 75% to\~$7 billion in projects, with 70% preleased or under contract ($7B pipeline, 200 MW added pipeline). As of early 2025, DLR has 2,850 MW operational, 5,000 MW buildable capacity, and expects 734 MW coming online within one year. The company can support nearly 4 GW of additional capacity based on its current land bank strategy, even beyond immediate projects |[Digital Realty Trust Q2 2025:AI Expansion Drives Growth Amid Market Challenges](https://www.monexa.ai/blog/digital-realty-trust-q2-2025-ai-expansion-drives-g-DLR-2025-07-02) <br>[DLR 2024 Impact Report](https://s29.q4cdn.com/106493612/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Digital-Realty-2024-Impact-Report.pdf)</br> <br>[Digital Realty Makes The Jump To Hyperspace With Lucasfilm Deal, Ups Annual Guidance To $6B](https://www.crn.com/news/data-center/2025/digital-realty-makes-the-jump-to-hyperspace-with-lucasfilm-deal-ups-annual-guidance-to-6b?)</br> <br>[Digital Realty Rides Secular Waves of Growth in its First 20 Years](https://www.reit.com/news/articles/digital-realty-rides-secular-waves-of-growth-in-its-first-20-years)</br> |
||**Power Procurement Strategy**|Diversified Long-term Contracts| **0**| Digital Realty’s 2024 Impact Report confirms 1.5 GW of new solar and wind projects under contract, supporting 75% renewable energy coverage globally across\~185 data centers. Additional PPAs signed in Spain and France (five renewable energy agreements signed May 2024) add diversified long-term procurement exposure across EMEA markets. A 10-year PPA with ENGIE in Germany (Brandenburg), covering\~120 GWh annually (116 MW share), demonstrates geographic diversification and long-duration contracting. |[Digital Realty Signs Five Renewable Energy Deals to Serve Spain and France](https://www.digitalrealty.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/123270/digital-realty-signs-five-renewable-energy-deals-to-serve-spain-and-france) <br>[2023 ESG Report](https://s29.q4cdn.com/106493612/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/report_digital_realty_2406_2023_esg_report.pdf) </br>|
|**Energy Cost Management & Volatility**|**Power Cost Hedging/Stabilization**| Comprehensive Hedging | **2**| DLR has 1.5 GW of renewable power under contract, backed by long-term PPAs spanning multiple geographies, which provides cost certainty and acts as a hedge against energy market fluctuations. The company issued €600 million in green bonds (first for a data center REIT) to finance sustainability-linked projects—indirectly supporting fixed-cost infrastructure and collectively reducing exposure to energy price hikes.DLR also joined 24/7 hourly renewable energy matching programs in Sweden and France in early 2025, further stabilizing renewable energy sourcing and aligning purchases with actual consumption—enhancing cost predictability. | [Green bonds](https://www.digitalrealty.com/about/esg/green-bond) <br>[Digital Realty Joins Innovative 24/7 Hourly Energy Matching Programs in Sweden and France](https://www.digitalrealty.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/123307/digital-realty-joins-innovative-24-7-hourly-energy-matching-programs-in-sweden-and-france)</br>|
||**Energy Cost Transparency & Management** | Basic Disclosure| **3**| DLR’s 2024 impact report shares PUE and efficiency data and renewable metrics, but lacks granular cost per kWh or facility-level power budgeting. |[DLR 2024 Impact Report](https://s29.q4cdn.com/106493612/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Digital-Realty-2024-Impact-Report.pdf)|
|**Operational Energy Efficiency**|**Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)** |1.4-1.6 (estimated) | **10**| DLR does not publicly report averaged PUE values for its data center portfolio, as noted in its sustainability communications. A historic case study from Digital Realty’s Santa Clara campus reported a PUE of\~1.6 when partially utilized (\~53%), highlighting that their real-world values have reached this range. Broad industry data (Lawrence Berkeley Lab 2024) shows average U.S. data center PUE around 1.4 in 2023, trending toward 1.35–1.15 by 2028—but only hyper-scale providers reach sub-1.25 routinely.

## Geographic Risk Evaluation
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
|**Asset Geographic Concentration Risk**| Well Diversified|**0**|As of mid‑2024, Digital Realty operated 300+ data centers in over 50 metropolitan areas across 25+ countries on six continents|[DLR DC](https://www.digitalrealty.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/123251/digital-realty-lays-foundation-to-private-ai-with-second-data-center-in-nrt-campus-boosts-ai-ready-data-center-capacity-in-metropolitan-tokyo)  |
| **Revenue Geographic Concentration Risk** |Well Diversified|**0**|Revenue is broadly distributed across North America, EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Europe and Asia‑Pacific are highlighted as major growth markets, with Asia‑Pacific revenue projected to reach\~$1.22B in 2025 rising to $1.56B in 2026 and beyond.  ||
| **High‑Risk Geographic Exposure** |Low Exposure| **0**|DLR’s global footprints are diversified across stable markets with minimal exposure to known high-risk grids, regulatory hotspots, or climate-vulnerable regions.||
| **Natural Disaster & Climate Risk** | Low Risk |**1**|Only a limited portion of DLR’s global portfolio sits in hazard-prone zones; most data centers are located in stable regions with robust design mitigation measures. A minority of sites reside in regions with elevated natural hazard exposure, such as coastal areas prone to hurricanes or flood events (e.g., Florida, Texas, California), seismic zones (California), and PJM-interconnected urban sites. Resilience is embedded in DLR’s property lifecycle: site selection, design, insurance, and preparedness are aligned with TCFD-aligned risk assessments. |[AMT Disaster Response](https://www.americantower.com/us/media-hub/blog/weathering-worst-inside-teams-keeping-you-connected)  |
| **Market Saturation & Competition Risk**  |High Saturation|**6**|Vacancy rates are near historical lows (e.g.\~1.5% in North America,\~0.4% in Northern Virginia), leading to rent and pricing momentum—but also making expansions more difficult. Digital Realty controls a market-leading 8.5% share of the global data center inventory, with fierce competition in key U.S. and EMEA metros like Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley, London, and Frankfurt. Many of DLR’s largest customers (e.g. AWS, Microsoft, Google) are also building hyperscale campuses, directly competing for the same power-rich landbanks and leasing structures.| |



## Customer Concentration Risk.
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Single Customer Dependency** | Relatively Low Dependency | **4** |Digital Realty’s largest customer accounted for ≈11.5% of aggregate annual recurring revenue—above 10% but below 25%.|  |
| **Top Customer Portfolio Concentration**     | Moderately Concentrated |**5**| Top 5 customers comprise 40–60% of recurring revenue (based on peers and industry context)—Digital Realty serves over 5,000 customers, with top few significant.| |
| **Customer Type & Pricing Power Risk**       | Moderate Risk | **5**| Serves mix of hyperscalers, cloud providers and enterprise clients. Hyperscale customers exert bargaining leverage, though enterprise portfolio provides balance. |   |
| **Contract Duration & Revenue Stability**    | Strong Protection | **0**|	Utilizes long-term leases and Master Services Agreements (MSAs) with tenants; recurring colocation contracts provide contractual stability. |   |
| **Customer Financial Quality & Credit Risk** | High Quality  | **0**  | Customers include financially strong hyperscalers (e.g. AWS, Microsoft) and large enterprise firms with robust credit profiles.| |
