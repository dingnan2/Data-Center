## Geographic Risk Evaluation
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Asset Geographic Concentration Risk**   |Well diversified| **0**|CoreSite owns and operates 30 data centers in 11 strategic U.S. metro markets, totaling over 4.5 million square feet of capacity. These markets include: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Northern Virginia, Orlando, Silicon Valley, Washington D.C.| [CoreSite DC](https://www.coresite.com/data-centers/locations)  |
| **Revenue Geographic Concentration Risk** |Well Diversified|**0**|U.S. & Canada property leasing: ~52% of revenue – spread across multiple metros (not one singularly dominating). International property leasing: Latin America (~17%), Asia-Pacific/Africa (~12%), Europe (~8%), all broadly dispersed geographically. Data centers (via CoreSite): ~9% of total company revenue, distributed across 11 U.S. metro markets|[2024 Annual Report](https://americantower.gcs-web.com/static-files/d9bdd953-3407-4bff-bca3-ca6d826b6b8b) |
| **High‑Risk Geographic Exposure** |Low Exposure   | **0**|PAs of December 31, 2024, our communications real estate portfolio of 148,957 communications sites included 42,222 communications sites in the U.S. & Canada, 26,642 communications sites in Africa & APAC (as defined below), 31,786 communications sites in Europe and 48,307 communications sites in Latin America, as well as (i) urban telecommunications assets in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, South Africa and Spain, (ii) other property interests in Canada and the United States and (iii) 29 data center facilities across ten markets in the United States. CoreSite span across 11 U.S. markets—Northern Virginia is one but represents a small share of total data center footprint and corporate portfolio   |[2024 Annual Report](https://americantower.gcs-web.com/static-files/d9bdd953-3407-4bff-bca3-ca6d826b6b8b)  [AMT Global Presence](https://www.americantower.com/global-presence)|
| **Natural Disaster & Climate Risk** | Low Risk |**2**|AMT operates ~42,200 tower sites in the U.S. & Canada, plus ~30 CoreSite data centers across 10 U.S. metros (including Miami, Northern Virginia, New York, Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, Chicago, Boston, Denver, Atlanta, Orlando). CoreSite report confirms that facilities in MI1, NY1, NY2 are located in 100‑year flood plains, but equipment is elevated and hardened above flood levels. AMT’s sustainability disclosures indicate exposure to hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes. However, mitigation protocols are embedded via TCFD-aligned climate assessments, annual DR/BCP plans, and operational resilience teams. AMT’s presence in hurricane or flood-prone U.S. metros is relatively small, and robust business continuity procedures (e.g. elevated infrastructure, DR planning) support resilience. The majority of sites lie in low-risk regions, and climate-appointed governance mitigates potential disruption. |[AMT Disaster Response](https://www.americantower.com/us/media-hub/blog/weathering-worst-inside-teams-keeping-you-connected)  |
| **Market Saturation & Competition Risk**  |Moderate Saturation|**4**|Competitive Intensity in Tower Leasing: Analysts note concerns about market saturation and competition in U.S. wireless tower infrastructure. Though growth remains driven by 5G and densification, leasing markets in mature metros are crowded.  CoreSite Data Center Competition: CoreSite operates in 11 U.S. metro hubs, many of which—including Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley, and New York—are densely saturated with competing hyperscale colocation facilities such as Equinix, Digital Realty, and others. Edge Strategy Diversification: AMT is actively investing in the edge—deploying micro data centers at tower sites across emerging metro zones (e.g., Pittsburgh, Jacksonville, Denver, Boulder), where competitive saturation is generally lower.| |

## Customer Concentration Risk.
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Single Customer Dependency** | Moderate Dependency | **8** |AMT’s largest customers—AT&T, Verizon, T‑Mobile—collectively accounted for ≈ 86% of U.S. & Canada property revenue, though no single carrier is >25% individually. This places exposure in the 10–25% band. | (https://www.barchart.com/story/news/32788748/should-you-hold-onto-american-tower-stock-in-your-portfolio-for-now) |
| **Top Customer Portfolio Concentration**     | Highly Concentrated | **15**    | Top three customers alone contribute \~45 % of property (leasing) revenue. While no top‑5 disclosure, this already breaches the >60 % threshold if including further top customers (e.g. Sprint, smaller carriers) to reach likely >60% of revenue concentration.  | |
| **Customer Type & Pricing Power Risk**       | Moderate Risk | **6**| Core customer base is dominated by **hyperscale telecom carriers** with strong procurement power and limited stickiness. While enterprise customers exist at CoreSite, the largest revenue share comes from telecom operators under volume/competitive pricing dynamics. |   |
| **Contract Duration & Revenue Stability**    | Strong Protection | **2**|Verizon lease structure spans initial 10-year term plus multiple 5‑year renewal options; lease terms often stretch 20–30 years with take-or-pay structure. Provides strong revenue backing.  |   |
| **Customer Financial Quality & Credit Risk** | High Quality  | **0**  | The major customers—AT\&T, Verizon, T‑Mobile—are large investment-grade telecom enterprises. CoreSite also serves enterprise, cloud, and large network clients, indicating high overall credit quality.   | |
