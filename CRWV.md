| **Power Infrastructure Resilience**| **Grid Redundancy & Backup Systems**|Basic Backup|**15**| CoreWeave has standard data center backup systems including diesel generators, UPS, and batteries at facilities like Denton. The Bloom Energy fuel cells at Illinois and dual feeds at New Jersey represent upgrades beyond minimal systems, but fall short of comprehensive backup infrastructure. Most facilities appear to rely on single utility feeds with standard generator backup, which qualifies as "Basic Backup" rather than comprehensive redundancy.| [Capacity Plans for CoreWeave Data Centers](https://www.coreweave.com/blog/our-capacity-plans-for-coreweave-data-centers) <br>[Bloom Energy Bringing Fuel Cell Power to CoreWeave Data Center Project in Illinois](https://www.microgridknowledge.com/data-center-microgrids/article/55126611/bloom-energy-bringing-fuel-cell-power-to-coreweave-data-center-project-in-illinois) </br> <br>[CoreWeave to convert New Jersey lab building into data center](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/coreweave-to-convert-new-jersey-lab-building-into-data-center/)</br>|
|| **Regional Power Constraint Exposure**|<25% in Risk Regions| **5**|While CoreWeave has significant exposure through major facilities in Texas (Denton's 390 MW) and Virginia power-constrained regions, the total percentage of facilities in high-risk regions appears to be less than 25% of their total portfolio. The company has diversified across multiple states and internationally, with substantial capacity in lower-risk regions like New Jersey, Illinois, Nevada, and Georgia. However, the concentration of large-capacity facilities in high-risk regions (particularly the 390 MW Denton facility) creates material operational risk despite representing a minority of total facilities.| [CoreWeave Data Center to Double City’s Power Needs as AI Strains US Supply](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coreweave-data-center-double-city-120000770.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9jbGF1ZGUuYWkv&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAI1C5X_XDMaAdmarD3mtkD8ISQAi2BnYBE-C-5E8PLHh3V_LYWSV_sGGNG7eYvunnHRg05Au4qZyW3RNJFBJbozkKbTc4lnZB0Us153JDfGBvZeR67884qGFPKsTrhLqbmnEe5h_qvqf7mbBm3lshgLmh3AvuU1wSf8WQjVZg640)<br>[CoreWeave's Texas Data Center Expansion: Grid Strain, Sustainability, and Investment Risks](https://www.ainvest.com/news/coreweave-texas-data-center-expansion-grid-strain-sustainability-investment-risks-2507/)</br>|
|**Capacity Growth & Scalability**| **Secured Future Power Capacity**| Multi‑Year Pipeline Secured |**0**|CoreWeave holds 1.3 GW of contracted power as of December 31, 2024, which will roll out over the coming years. The Core Scientific acquisition adds approximately 1.3 GW of operational power plus an incremental 1 GW+ of potential expansion capacity, providing a multi-year growth runway totaling 3.6+ GW potential capacity. The company added 300 MW of contracted power in Q1 2025 and expects to double deployed power by year-end.|[CoreWeave beats on revenue, reports more than 400% growth in first earnings after IPO](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/coreweave-crwv-q1-2025-earnings-report.html) <br>[Acquisition of Core Scientific](https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-to-Acquire-Core-Scientific/default.aspx)</br>|
| |**Power Procurement Strategy**|Some Long-term|**5**|CoreWeave has selective long-term PPA arrangements including a large-scale solar and wind PPA in Spain and a 100MW solar farm for an upcoming data center. However, their approach appears regionally selective rather than systematically diversified, with management stating they use "PPAs where we need them" and avoid them in regions with stable pricing. The lack of published renewable energy strategy and limited public disclosure suggests a more tactical than comprehensive procurement approach.|[CoreWeave has "large scale" solar and wind PPA in Spain](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/coreweave-has-large-scale-solar-and-wind-ppa-in-spain/)|
| **Cost Management & Volatility**|**Power Cost Hedging/Stabilization Strategy**| Partial Hedging| **5**| CoreWeave has dedicated energy procurement roles that explicitly include financial hedging and hedging strategies for managing power price volatility and supply disruptions. Job postings for Energy Procurement Director and Manager positions specifically mention hedging as core responsibilities. However, SEC filings provide no disclosure of material hedging activities or derivative instruments, suggesting the approach may be limited in scope rather than comprehensive. Leadership includes energy trading expertise through Chief Development Officer's background in power markets.|  |
||**Energy Cost Transparency & Management**| Minimal Disclosure| **7**| CoreWeave provides basic operational cost disclosure through SEC filings, reporting $493 million in "cost of revenue" that includes data center rental, power, and personnel expenses, but lacks specific energy cost breakdowns or detailed operational metrics. The company has no dedicated sustainability report or formal ESG reporting framework, providing limited transparency beyond regulatory requirements. While power capacity metrics are disclosed (1.6 GW contracted), specific energy costs, efficiency targets, or detailed cost management strategies are not publicly available.|[Cost structure disclosure](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798ds1.htm)  |
| **Operational Energy Efficiency** |**Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)**|1.25-1.4|**5**| CoreWeave's data centers are purpose-built for AI with liquid cooling capabilities enabling ~130kW racks.Modern AI-optimized facilities with liquid cooling typically achieve PUE in the 1.25-1.4 range, well below the industry average of 1.58.|[Capacity Plans for CoreWeave Data Centers](https://www.coreweave.com/blog/our-capacity-plans-for-coreweave-data-centers)|
||**Efficiency Improvement Trajectory** | Stable Performance | **3**| Evidence of continuous upgrades — liquid cooling, high-density racks, fuel cell microgrids, new facility standards, but lacks historical efficiency data to demonstrate "improving trend."|[CoreWeave Builds Ecosystem Momentum](https://www.futuriom.com/articles/news/coreweave-builds-ecosystem-momentum/2024/10)|
| **Sustainability & Regulatory Risk** | **Renewable Energy Integration**|50–75% Renewable| **5**|CoreWeave reported majority renewable energy operations in select buildings, and their Spain operations run on renewable PPAs. Given their European expansion and sustainability focus, the overall portfolio likely achieves 50-75% renewable energy integration. |[CoreWeave S-1/A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525058309/d899798ds1a.htm)|

## Geographic Risk Evaluation
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Asset Geographic Concentration Risk**|Well Diversified| **1**|As of early 2025, CoreWeave operates 33 data centers across North America and Europe, representing over 420 MW of active power infrastructure. In Europe, CoreWeave has operational facilities in London (Docklands, Crawley) and Barcelona, with more planned projects across Spain, Sweden, Norway, and UK (~$2.2B in planned expansion). Regions are diversified across three U.S. time zones and multiple European countries—no more than ~30–40% of assets in any single metro area or country.| [APLD DC](https://baxtel.com/data-centers/applied-digital)  |
| **Revenue Geographic Concentration Risk** |Well Diversified|**1**|In 2024, CoreWeave reported ~$1.9 billion in total revenue. Of that, an estimated $1.8 billion was generated from the United States, with only ~$118 million from “All Other Countries” including the U.K. (~6% of the total). Q1 2025 revenue escalated to $982 million, largely driven by U.S.-based operations.  |  |
| **High‑Risk Geographic Exposure** |Minimal Exposure| **4**|Key U.S. metro presences include Pennsylvania (Lancaster), Texas (Denton/Plano), New Jersey, Chicago, Oregon, Georgia, and others. European sites are in London, Barcelona, and future builds in Spain, Sweden, Norway, and the UK. In Pennsylvania, CoreWeave is investing $6 billion for a 300 MW AI campus. The project comes after the governor threatened to exit PJM Interconnection due to soaring electricity demand from AI data centers—signaling grid strain and regulatory scrutiny. ([turn0news21]). In Texas (Denton/Plano), expansion is projected to double the city’s electricity needs, raising concerns around local grid capacity, infrastructure sufficiency, and sustainability. The grid stability issues in both PJM (PA) and ERCOT (Texas) are recognized as stumbling blocks for heavy data center expansion, leading to potential curtailment risks or policy-driven capacity constraints. Sites in the UK and Spain benefit from generally more reliable grid environments, albeit long-term regulatory and ESG planning is needed—but current exposure to high-risk policy zones in Europe is minimal. | [CoreWeave Data Center to Double City’s Power Needs as AI Strains US Supply](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-14/coreweave-expands-dallas-area-data-center-power-grid-strains-grow)|
| **Natural Disaster & Climate Risk** | Moderate Risk |**3**|Pennsylvania (Lancaster): located in Tornado Alley and flood-prone regions. CoreWeave plans a 300 MW IT campus here. Texas (Denton/Plano & West Texas): reports confirm the facility will double Denton’s power demand. Texas frequently faces tornadoes, storms, and floods. DCs in Europe are situated in areas  with low historic exposure to major natural disasters—generally lower-risk. Of ~33 global data centers, ~2–3 are in particularly high-risk U.S. regions (Pennsylvania and Texas), |[Disaster Center](https://disastercenter.com/)  |
| **Market Saturation & Competition Risk**  |High Saturation|**8**|CoreWeave operates in direct competition with hyperscale giants—such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure—as well as other GPU cloud providers like Lambda Labs, Crusoe, Together AI, and Vertiv. These players offer broad, integrated AI infrastructure services across global footprint and scale. The company faces criticism for high customer concentration (Microsoft accounts for ~62% of 2024 revenue, top two customers ~77%) and heavy debt/capex burden, which may restrict flexibility in price competition.CoreWeave is undertaking massive expansion, including investments like $6 billion in a Lancaster, PA campus and $2.2 billion in European builds, but these regions also host established colocation providers—intensifying competition.  |[CoreWeave to Set up New Data Center: Overcapacity or Future-Proofing?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/coreweave-set-new-data-center-overcapacity-or-future-proofing) |



## Customer Concentration Risk.
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Single Customer Dependency** | High Dependency | **18** |Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave’s total revenue in 2024, clearly exceeding the >25% threshold. |  |
| **Top Customer Portfolio Concentration**     | Highly Concentrated | **13**    | Top two customers (Microsoft + Customer C) made up 77% of revenue in 2024; top three ~<80% (S‑1 data). This places the company well into highest risk category. | |
| **Customer Type & Pricing Power Risk**       | Possible High Risk | **10**| 		Customers are hyperscaler/AI labs (Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia); they wield strong bargaining leverage, high volume demand, and can exert pricing pressure or take infrastructure in-house if desired. |   |
| **Contract Duration & Revenue Stability**    | Strong Protection | **1**|	CoreWeave has multi‑year committed contracts and substantial revenue backlog (~$25.9 B as of March 31, 2025) with long-term AI partners—not month‑to‑month exposure. |   |
| **Customer Financial Quality & Credit Risk** | Mixed Quality  | **1**  | CoreWeave’s top customers (Microsoft, OpenAI, Nvidia) are well‑capitalized, investment-grade or institutionally backed, representing strong ability to meet financial obligations. | |
