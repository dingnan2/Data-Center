| **Power Infrastructure Resilience**|**Grid Redundancy & Backup**| Basic Backup| **15**|Applied Digital is implementing next-generation medium-voltage UPS (HiPerGuard) with implied resilience benefits. Strategic design mentions “redundant systems” but offers no clarity on grid feed redundancy or long-duration backup generator architecture.|[ABB and Applied Digital Build a Template for AI-Ready Data Centers](https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/design/article/55298423/abb-and-applied-digital-build-a-template-for-ai-ready-data-centers)|
| |**Regional Power Constraint Exposure**| <25% in Risk Regions | **5**|APLD’s Ellendale campus (286 MW with up to 400 MW planned) operates in North Dakota grid network rated as highly reliable, unlike Texas ERCOT or California’s grids. Emerging APLD sites in South Dakota and Iowa reinforce the focus on low-risk power regions.| [APLD & North Dakota](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/applied-digital-signs-250mw-agreement-with-coreweave-for-capacity-at-ellendale-campus-north-dakota/) <br>[South Dakota](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/applied-digital-proposes-multi-billion-dollar-data-center-in-south-dakota/)</br>|
| **Capacity Growth & Scalability**|**Secured Future Power Capacity**| Multi‑Year Pipeline Secured | **0**| Ellendale campus plans for 400 MW of IT load with staged rollouts (2025–2027), already 286 MW live.Company-specific statements reveal capacity expansion plans to exceed 1 GW across multiple sites in North Dakota, Iowa, and South Dakota, backed by $5 billion funding agreement.Financing terms include rights to future capacity project funding, providing multi-year runway| [Applied Digital Announces 250MW AI Data Center Lease With CoreWeave in North Dakota](https://ir.applieddigital.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/123/applied-digital-announces-250mw-ai-data-center-lease-with) <br>[Applied Digital has more gigawatt-scale data centers up its sleeve](https://www.fierce-network.com/cloud/applied-digital-has-more-gigawatt-scale-data-centers-its-sleeve)</br>|
| |**Power Procurement Strategy**|Some Long‑Term| **5**|A formal 200 MW Retail Electric Service Agreement (effectively a long-term PPA) was signed on December 19, 2023, between Applied Digital and TerraForm Power, a Brookfield-owned renewable energy operator, to power its Garden City data center in Texas by directly interconnecting with a wind farm in Glasscock Count. |[Applied Digital Announces Long-Term Supply Agreement with TerraForm Power](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/19/2798475/0/en/Applied-Digital-Announces-Long-Term-Supply-Agreement-with-TerraForm-Power.html)  |
| **Cost Management & Volatility**| Power Cost Hedging/Stabilization |Limited Hedging| **8**| APLD’s 2023 utility contract establishes a ceiling on energy costs at one calibrated site, but no public documentation shows portfolio-wide PPAs or structured hedging strategies. APLD’s strategy highlights cost savings through design and site location rather than formal hedging.| [Contractual Ceiling for energy cost](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1144879/000149315224039591/forms-1.htm) |
|  |**Energy Cost Transparency & Management**|Basic Disclosure | **2** | Annual report (November 30, 2024) indicates a $2.8 million decrease in energy costs compared to prior period due to improved pricing.Company white paper (“AI Factory”) and press releases highlight how site selection and design can reduce annual energy cost by $50–60 million per 100 MW campus. However, these are model-based projections—not actual cost disclosures. |[$2.7 Billion in Data Center Savings: New Applied Digital Report Positions North Dakota as the Epicenter for AI Infrastructure](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/APLD/2-7-billion-in-data-center-savings-new-applied-digital-report-vejzalnup003.html)|
| **Operational Energy Efficiency**| **Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)**|≤1.25** |**0**| Polaris Forge 01 projected PUE of \~1.18; other designs target around 1.17.

## Geographic Risk Evaluation
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Asset Geographic Concentration Risk**|Highly Concentrated| **18**|APLD’s data center footprint is almost entirely in North & South Dakota (single U.S. region); >60% of operational and planned assets are concentrated in one energy grid zone. CEO statements confirm all public APLD campuses—so far—are located in the MISO energy region spanning North & South Dakota, with no data centers outside this region as of mid-2025.| [APLD DC](https://baxtel.com/data-centers/applied-digital)  |
| **Revenue Geographic Concentration Risk** | Highly Concentrated|**15**|Applied Digital’s total trailing annual revenue for Fiscal Year 2024 was ~$166M. Revenue from Data Center Hosting (i.e. leasing of Ellendale and Jamestown sites in North Dakota) for Q3 FY2025 was $35.2M, slightly less YoY, representing the majority of the segment’s revenue. APLD operates only in North Dakota (Ellendale and Jamestown campuses) for its data center hosting operations, with no disclosed presence outside this state as of early 2025 |  |
| **High‑Risk Geographic Exposure** |High‑Risk Exposure| **15**|The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) region—which includes North & South Dakota—is identified by NERC as a high-risk area for potential future power supply shortfalls, even at baseline summer demand, due to aging infrastructure, renewables integration challenges, and generator retirements. North Dakota grid studies confirm that decreased baseline generation from retiring lignite plants could amplify future capacity shortfalls. | |
| **Natural Disaster & Climate Risk** | Moderate Risk |**5**|In June 2025, a tornado/derecho event in eastern North Dakota caused at least three fatalities, destroyed homes, snapped power infrastructure, and resulted in widespread outages (~20k people impacted). Fargo-Moorhead area plans and infrastructure (e.g. Red River valley) remain vulnerable to spring floods; mitigation projects (like the $3.2B Diversion Project) are under development but not yet fully operational (completion by 2027).Eastern North Dakota (e.g. Cass and Ransom counties) is within the Red River basin with a historical pattern of flood events |[APLD North Dakota](https://disastercenter.com/northdak/northdak.htm)  |
| **Market Saturation & Competition Risk**  |Moderate Saturation|**4**|APLD operates in a relatively low-density region but faces competition from larger hyperscale data center providers and GPU-cloud partners in broader global markets. APLD’s operations are entirely concentrated at its Polaris Forge campuses in North Dakota, which is a nascent and emerging data center region—not a mature market like Northern Virginia or Silicon Valley. APLD has signed a 250 MW, 15-year lease with CoreWeave, an Nvidia-backed hyperscaler, signaling strong alignment with AI demand and competitive positioning within the GPU cloud ecosystem. APLD’s infrastructure at Ellendale leverages unique design elements: liquid-to-chip cooling, medium-voltage UPS systems via ABB’s HiPerGuard platform, free-cooling, and low-cost renewable power access, providing cost-efficiency and infrastructure advantage| |



## Customer Concentration Risk.
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Single Customer Dependency** | High Dependency | **18** |In the 6 months ended Nov 30 2024, Customer A alone accounted for 49–51% of revenue; Customer H represented another 27–28%, and G ~16%. Combined, the top one client is >25%, indicating high dependency. |  |
| **Top Customer Portfolio Concentration**     | Highly Concentrated | **15**    | The top 3 customers together made up over 90% of revenue in the prior six-month period (51+28+16 ≈ 95%). This places top-customer concentration in the highest risk threshold. | |
| **Customer Type & Pricing Power Risk**       | Possible High Risk | **10**| 	Customers include hyperscaler AI/cloud users (e.g., CoreWeave), and AI-first firms, who command strong negotiation leverage and volume-driven rates. Reliance on a few large, likely price-sensitive clients increases risk. |   |
| **Contract Duration & Revenue Stability**    | Strong Protection | **1**|	Applied Digital recently signed **two 15-year leases worth $7b** with CoreWeave—ensuring long-term committed revenue. Other contracts include multi-year arrangements with fixed commitments. |   |
| **Customer Financial Quality & Credit Risk** | Mixed Quality  | **3**  | Customers include well-funded hyperscale/AI firms like CoreWeave and Together AI. While well financed, these are growth-stage tech entrants with less established credit profiles than investment‑grade corporates.  | |
