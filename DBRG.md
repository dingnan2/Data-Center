## Geographic Risk Evaluation
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Asset Geographic Concentration Risk**| Well Diversified|**0**|DigitalBridge Group is primarily an investment manager, holding stakes across multiple data center investment platforms spanning global markets, with no clear over-concentration in any single region. DigitalBridge invests through (i) Vantage Data Centers (32+ hyperscale campuses across North America and EMEA across 5 continents), (ii) DataBank (~60+ data centers in 30+ markets), (iii) other stakeholdings including Yondr Group, Switch Inc, regional edge platforms like Leading Edge Data Centres (Australia), Aptum, AtlasEdge, etc. Their portfolio spans North America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America, via multiple controlled entities. No single company or metro dominates. For instance, Vantage alone operates in 25+ sites across North America and EMEA, not confined to a single country or region.  | [CoreSite DC](https://www.coresite.com/data-centers/locations)  |
| **Revenue Geographic Concentration Risk** |Well Diversified|**0**|DBRG’s revenue stems from management of multiple portfolio platforms including Vantage Data Centers, DataBank, Switch, Yondr Group, Aptum, Leading Edge, and others. Revenue sources are management fees, incentive fees, and investment earnings from multiple funds rather than direct data-center leasing. |[2024 Annual Report](https://americantower.gcs-web.com/static-files/d9bdd953-3407-4bff-bca3-ca6d826b6b8b) |
| **High‑Risk Geographic Exposure** |Well Diversified| **0**|Vantage Data Centers, a core DBRG-backed platform, operates 25+ campuses across North America and EMEA, spanning five continents with over 3 GW of expected capacity. While some regions—like parts of North America—include states with grid constraints (e.g. PJM, ERCOT), DBRG’s exposures via Vantage are distributed across multiple developed markets. No single country or metro accounts for more than 40% of DBRG’s overall investment footprint in digital infrastructure. There is no material exposure to high-risk regulatory zones (e.g., China) or underdeveloped markets with weak power infrastructure.|[2024 Annual Report](https://americantower.gcs-web.com/static-files/d9bdd953-3407-4bff-bca3-ca6d826b6b8b)  [Vantage Data Centers Announces $6.4 Billion Equity Investment Led by DigitalBridge and Silver Lake](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/vantage-data-centers-announces-%246.4-billion-equity-investment-led-by-digitalbridge)|
| **Natural Disaster & Climate Risk** | Moderate Risk |**5**|DBRG invests through Vantage Data Centers, DataBank, Switch, Yondr, Aptum, Leading Edge, etc.—covering 25+ campuses in North America and EMEA and across five continents. Certain key regions include coastal / hurricane zones (e.g., Northeast U.S., Florida exposures), flood plains, and areas susceptible to earthquakes (e.g., California). DBRG’s 10-K explicitly cites potential risks from “earthquake, hurricane, flood, climate change…” impacting data center operations across its portfolio. While some campuses reside in natural-hazard-prone areas, DBRG’s portfolio is global—with facilities in stable regions like London, Dublin, Frankfurt, Asia-Pacific cities like Osaka, Melbourne, Cyberjaya, and others.|[AMT Disaster Response](https://www.americantower.com/us/media-hub/blog/weathering-worst-inside-teams-keeping-you-connected)  |
| **Market Saturation & Competition Risk**  |Moderate Saturation|**4**|DBRG operates through platforms in highly competitive Tier-1 markets, but benefits from deep industry positioning and capital scale. DBRG-backed platforms operate in highly mature colocation markets like Silicon Valley (Santa Clara), Northern Virginia, Chicago, Dallas, London, Dublin, and Frankfurt—where hyperscale providers (Equinix, Digital Realty, CoreSite, CyrusOne) dominate demand and pricing structures. DBRG stewards platforms with strong partnerships and deep capital backing (e.g., $9.2 B equity raise into Vantage), but continues to face stiff competition for AI and cloud hosting contracts globally| |


## Customer Concentration Risk.
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Single Customer Dependency** | - | - |DigitalBridge operates as an investment manager with no single LP or customer accounting for >25% of total fees or revenue disclosed in filings. No client-level concentration details are publicly disclosed. |  |
| **Top Customer Portfolio Concentration**     | - |-   |  	The company does not disclose the revenue share of its top 5 or top 10 LPs or investors; fee and carried interest revenue are aggregated. No granular client revenue concentration data is available. | |
| **Customer Type & Pricing Power Risk**       | Mixed | **5**| 		Clients include institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds. These are typically stable but may negotiate on fees. Some reliance on large limited partners may dilute fee flexibility. |   |
| **Contract Duration & Revenue Stability**    | Moderate Protection | **4**|	Long-term fund commitments support revenue stability. However, redemption terms vary by fund and LP, and contracts are not uniform; some funds may be evergreen or subject to withdrawal windows. Lack of client‑by‑client term detail. |   |
| **Customer Financial Quality & Credit Risk** | Mixed Quality  | **1**  | DigitalBridge serves institutional LPs, large pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign investors, all of which have strong credit profiles. Default risk is minimal.| |
