| **Power Infrastructure Resilience**  | **Grid Redundancy & Backup Systems** | Multiple Grid Connections| **0**| All Equinix IBX data centers are built to **N+1 or 2N** standards, with concurrently maintainable A/B feeds, UPS, and diesel generators. Tier III or higher design in major metros ensures continuous uptime. |[Equinix IBX Standards](https://www.equinix.com/resources/design-standards.com)|
|| **Regional Power Constraint Exposure** | <25% in Risk Regions  | **0**|VNET operates predominantly in China across zones with generally stable grid availability. Major data centers are located in Eastern Data-Western Computing regions like Inner Mongolia (e.g. Ulanqab) and Beijing region, avoiding acute grid risk hotspots like California or Northern Virginia.| [Equinix Global Locations](https://www.equinix.com/data-centers.com) |
| **Capacity Growth & Scalability**    | **Secured Future Power Capacity** | Multi-Year Pipeline Secured| **0**| Equinix has secured multi-year power capacity pipeline through: (1) 62 major projects underway adding >165 MW by end-2026, (2) $15+ billion joint venture with CPP/GIC to add >1.5 GW capacity in multi-hundred MW campuses, and (3) existing $8 billion JV portfolio delivering >725 MW across 35+ facilities.

|| **Power Procurement Strategy**  | Diversified Long-term Contracts | **0**     | Uses **long-term PPAs, green tariffs, and direct utility agreements** for renewable and conventional power globally; very little reliance on spot markets.| [Equinix 2024 Sustainability Report](https://sustainability.equinix.com)|
| **Cost Management & Volatility** | **Power Cost Hedging/Stabilization Strategy** | Partial Hedging| **5**| Equinix's energy cost stabilization strategy relies primarily on long-term PPAs (1.2 GW contracted) for price predictability, combined with energy efficiency measures and conservation efforts. However, the 2024 10-K explicitly states that power costs remain 'volatile and unpredictable' despite hedging efforts, indicating limited comprehensive financial hedging for energy price volatility. The company uses extensive foreign currency and interest rate hedging but shows limited evidence of direct energy commodity price hedging. | [Equinix 2024 10-K](https://investor.equinix.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001628280-25-005126/eqix-20241231.htm) |
|   | **Energy Cost Transparency & Management**| Basic Disclosure  | **3**     | Equinix provides strong environmental transparency through SASB-compliant reporting, customer-level Green Power Reports, detailed renewable energy coverage (96%), and comprehensive PUE metrics (1.39). However, the company offers limited detailed energy cost breakdown or pricing strategy disclosure. Energy costs are reported generically as 'utilities costs' with only basic seasonal variations mentioned. While sustainability reporting is excellent, financial energy cost transparency is basic.| [Equinix ESG Reports](https://sustainability.equinix.com) <br> [Equinix 2024 10-K](https://investor.equinix.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001628280-25-005126/eqix-20241231.htm)</br> |

## Geographic Risk Evaluation
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Asset Geographic Concentration Risk**   |Well diversified| **0**|Equinix presence includes North America (~85+ facilities), Latin America (Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru), Europe (UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain, etc.), Middle East (UAE, Oman), Asia-Pacific (Australia, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea, India), and Africa (Nigeria, South Africa). Region-level: Even U.S. exposure (~North America) is less than 60% given substantial EMEA, APAC, LATAM, and Africa presence. Metro-level: Equinix’s sites are widely spread across ~70+ metros; no city surpasses the 40% threshold.|  |
| **Revenue Geographic Concentration Risk** |Well Diversified|**0**|Equinix’s revenue is well distributed across key regions—no single metro or country exceeds competitive thresholds.|  |
| **High‑Risk Geographic Exposure** |Moderate Exposure   | **6**|Notable U.S. clusters include Silicon Valley (“Great Oaks”), Northern Virginia (“Data Center Alley”), and Miami (NAP of the Americas) — all key power‑intensive regions. Silicon Valley: Over 50 data centers consume ~60% of Santa Clara’s municipal utility capacity, pushing grid load and risking blackouts. Northern Virginia/PJM: In July 2024, ~60 data centers in the region disconnected simultaneously due to a surge protector failure, prompting 1.5 GW of unplanned grid withdrawal and near systemic instability.  Regulators have flagged grid reliability risks driven by hyperscale and colocation growth, especially in Virginia and Texas. Equinix incorporates climate resilience into site selection and design standards, but physical campuses in these high-risk zones remain operational and significant in scale.  |[2024 Annual Report](https://americantower.gcs-web.com/static-files/d9bdd953-3407-4bff-bca3-ca6d826b6b8b)  [AMT Global Presence](https://www.americantower.com/global-presence)|
| **Natural Disaster & Climate Risk** | Moderate Risk |**3**|Equinix has several IBX data centers in high-risk U.S. coastal/metropolitan areas, including Miami (MI1), Silicon Valley (Great Oaks), Northern Virginia, and Florida/Texas corridors, which face elevated hurricane, heat, and flood risk. MI1, for example, is built 14 feet above sea level with 7‑inch walls and engineered for Category 5 winds. Equinix utilizes TCFD-aligned risk assessments, modeling for physical risks (wildfire, flood, drought, extreme heat) and embedding mitigation into site design and operations. A meaningful subset of Equinix’s ~260‑270 IBX facilities (approx. 20–30%) are located in regions subject to elevated natural disaster or climate risk—mostly in the U.S., with a smaller proportion globally facing heat/drought stress.| |

## Customer Concentration Risk.
| **Sub-Metric** | **Flag** | **Score** | **Justification** | **Reference** |
|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Single Customer Dependency** | Low Dependency | **0** |Equinix indicates that no single customer contributed 10% or more of revenue in recent years. Top client contribution is estimated ~3.5%.|  |
| **Top Customer Portfolio Concentration**     | Well Diversified |**0**| Top 50 customers collectively accounted for approximately 36% of recurring revenue; the top 10 are ~19%—well below concentration thresholds.| |
| **Customer Type & Pricing Power Risk**       | Favorable Mix | **0**|	Equinix serves thousands of enterprise, cloud, content, financial, and carrier customers. Pricing power is strong due to platform neutrality. |   |
| **Contract Duration & Revenue Stability**    | Strong Protection | **0**|	Contracts generally span 1–3 years (with high renewal rates), recurring revenues comprise >90% of total revenue—indicating stable contractual recurring bookings. |   |
| **Customer Financial Quality & Credit Risk** | Mixed Quality| **2**  | Equinix’s customers include investment-grade hyperscalers, telecom carriers, large enterprises—credit risk is minimal.|
